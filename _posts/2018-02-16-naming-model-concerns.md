title:  "Naming Model Concerns"
---
When naming model concerns. Try to suffix the name with "able", even if it isn't necessarily a word. If there is a feature concern call it _Featureable_, an image processor would be _ImageProcessable_, a bank balance concern would be _Balanceable_. It isn't a required constraint but I think it is generally clearer that you are making a model Featureable, ImageProcessable, or Balanceable where the concern is being applied to the model making it _able_ to do that thing.
